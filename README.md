This project is a responsive landing page built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, focusing on Tailwind CSS for styling. The design and layout showcase a modern aesthetic, highlighting various Tailwind utility classes to create a cohesive and visually appealing UI. This project serves as a practical exercise to apply and reinforce my recent learning of Tailwind CSS, aiming to improve both speed and efficiency in styling webpages.
